Installation instructions:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy the mlp file to a suitable directory where executables can be located,
preferrably in your path. This will normally be in /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin or
a similar place.  ( You can list your paths by entering 'env |grep ^PATH=' ).
You can also copy mlp in any other directory, perhaps in your home directory,
but you may have to use the full path to be able to run the program.

2. Copy mlp.conf in /etc, /etc/mlp, /usr/local/etc or your home catalog.  If
you choose your home catalog, you need to rename it to .mlprc. 

3. Edit mlp.conf, ( or .mlprc ), and adjust the settings as you like.  The file
includes a short description of the different parameters, and will give you an
understandig of what mlp is designed to do.
Note: Any command line parameter will override the settings in the config file.

4. Try to run 'mlp -h' from your command line to see if perl has all required
libraries.  You will most likely run into errors like:

    "Can't locate Term/ReadKey.pm in @INC ..".

You will then need to install the Term::Readkey library:

    Debian/Ubuntu/Mint: 'apt-get install libterm-readkey-perl'.
    Redhat/CentOS: 'yum install perl-TermReadKey.x86_64', (on 64-bit systems). 


Limitations:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mlp requires mail log files rotated daily in a certain format to function properly:

    <filename>.<digit>[.zip|.gz]. Typically something like "maillog.1.gz".

Other name schemes will be supported in a later release. You may avoid this problem
by piping the log files into mlp:

    "zcat /var/log/whatever-201309.gz | mlp".
